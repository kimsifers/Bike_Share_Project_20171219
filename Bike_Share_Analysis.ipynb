    "Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. You will also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users."

    "## Posing Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before looking at the bike sharing data, you should start by asking questions you might want to understand about the bike share data. Consider, for example, if you were working for Motivate. What kinds of information would you want to know about in order to make smarter business decisions? If you were a user of the bike-share service, what factors might influence how you would want to use the service?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1**: Write at least two questions related to bike sharing that you think could be answered by data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "In the past in these excercises, I have put these questions statistically.  This time I want to put the questions into business terms. \n",
    "1) How many bikes do I need for the next year? To make a this decision it this I need to understand how the bikes have been used this year, and then based on the data I can make a data based decision.  \n",
    "2) How many bikes does a Station need to have?  I could imagine that bikes could be moved from one station to another each day.  To make a data based decision, I need understand how many bikes are being used by each station in a day. \n"

    "\n",
    "Now it's time to collect and explore our data. In this project, we will focus on the record of individual trips taken in 2016 from our selected cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. Each of these cities has a page where we can freely download the trip data.:\n",
    "\n",
    "- New York City (Citi Bike): [Link](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)\n",
    "- Chicago (Divvy): [Link](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data)\n",
    "- Washington, DC (Capital Bikeshare): [Link](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you visit these pages, you will notice that each city has a different way of delivering its data. Chicago updates with new data twice a year, Washington DC is quarterly, and New York City is monthly. **However, you do not need to download the data yourself.** The data has already been collected for you in the `/data/` folder of the project files. While the original data for 2016 is spread among multiple files for each city, the files in the `/data/` folder collect all of the trip data for the year into one file per city. Some data wrangling of inconsistencies in timestamp format within each city has already been performed for you. In addition, a random 2% sample of the original data is taken to make the exploration more manageable. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2**: However, there is still a lot of data for us to investigate, so it's a good idea to start off by looking at one entry from each of the cities we're going to analyze. Run the first code cell below to load some packages and functions that you'll be using in your analysis. Then, complete the second code cell to print out the first trip recorded from each of the cities (the second line of each data file).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**: You can run a code cell like you formatted Markdown cells above by clicking on the cell and using the keyboard shortcut **Shift** + **Enter** or **Shift** + **Return**. Alternatively, a code cell can be executed using the **Play** button in the toolbar after selecting it. While the cell is running, you will see an asterisk in the message to the left of the cell, i.e. `In [*]:`. The asterisk will change into a number to show that execution has completed, e.g. `In [1]`. If there is output, it will show up as `Out [1]:`, with an appropriate number to match the \"In\" number."

    "If everything has been filled out correctly, you should see below the printout of each city name (which has been parsed from the data file name) that the first trip has been parsed in the form of a dictionary. When you set up a `DictReader` object, the first row of the data file is normally interpreted as column names. Every other row in the data file will use those column names as keys, as a dictionary is generated for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be useful since we can refer to quantities by an easily-understandable label instead of just a numeric index. For example, if we have a trip stored in the variable `row`, then we would rather get the trip duration from `row['duration']` instead of `row[0]`.\n",

    "It should also be observable from the above printout that each city provides different information. Even where the information is the same, the column names and formats are sometimes different. To make things as simple as possible when we get to the actual exploration, we should trim and clean the data. Cleaning the data makes sure that the data formats across the cities are consistent, while trimming focuses only on the parts of the data we are most interested in to make the exploration easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will generate new data files with five values of interest for each trip: trip duration, starting month, starting hour, day of the week, and user type. Each of these may require additional wrangling depending on the city:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Duration**: This has been given to us in seconds (New York, Chicago) or milliseconds (Washington). A more natural unit of analysis will be if all the trip durations are given in terms of minutes.\n",
    "- **Month**, **Hour**, **Day of Week**: Ridership volume is likely to change based on the season, time of day, and whether it is a weekday or weekend. Use the start time of the trip to obtain these values. The New York City data includes the seconds in their timestamps, while Washington and Chicago do not. The [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) package will be very useful here to make the needed conversions.\n",
    "- **User Type**: It is possible that users who are subscribed to a bike-share system will have different patterns of use compared to users who only have temporary passes. Washington divides its users into two types: 'Registered' for users with annual, monthly, and other longer-term subscriptions, and 'Casual', for users with 24-hour, 3-day, and other short-term passes. The New York and Chicago data uses 'Subscriber' and 'Customer' for these groups, respectively. For consistency, you will convert the Washington labels to match the other two. It also turns out that there are some trips in the New York city dataset that do not have an attached user type. Since we don't have enough information to fill these values in, just leave them as-is for now.\n",

    "If you followed the use of the `.hist()` and `.show()` functions exactly like in the example, you're probably looking at a plot that's completely unexpected. The plot consists of one extremely tall bar on the left, maybe a very short second bar, and a whole lot of empty space in the center and right. Take a look at the duration values on the x-axis. This suggests that there are some highly infrequent outliers in the data. Instead of reprocessing the data, you will use additional parameters with the `.hist()` function to limit the range of data that is plotted. Documentation for the function can be found [[here]](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html#matplotlib.pyplot.hist).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 5**: Use the parameters of the `.hist()` function to plot the distribution of trip times for the Subscribers in your selected city. Do the same thing for only the Customers. Add limits to the plots so that only trips of duration less than 75 minutes are plotted. As a bonus, set the plots up so that bars are in five-minute wide intervals. For each group, where is the peak of each distribution? How would you describe the shape of each distribution?\n",

    "## Performing Your Own Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you've performed an initial exploration into the data available. You have compared the relative volume of trips made between three U.S. cities and the ratio of trips made by Subscribers and Customers. For one of these cities, you have investigated differences between Subscribers and Customers in terms of how long a typical trip lasts. Now it is your turn to continue the exploration in a direction that you choose. Here are a few suggestions for questions to explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does ridership differ by month or season? Which month / season has the highest ridership? Does the ratio of Subscriber trips to Customer trips change depending on the month or season?\n",
    "- Is the pattern of ridership different on the weekends versus weekdays? On what days are Subscribers most likely to use the system? What about Customers? Does the average duration of rides change depending on the day of the week?\n",
    "- During what time of day is the system used the most? Is there a difference in usage patterns for Subscribers and Customers?\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of the questions you posed in your answer to question 1 align with the bullet points above, this is a good opportunity to investigate one of them. As part of your investigation, you will need to create a visualization. If you want to create something other than a histogram, then you might want to consult the [Pyplot documentation](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/pyplot_summary.html). In particular, if you are plotting values across a categorical variable (e.g. city, user type), a bar chart will be useful. The [documentation page for `.bar()`](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.bar.html#matplotlib.pyplot.bar) includes links at the bottom of the page with examples for you to build off of for your own use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 6**: Continue the investigation by exploring another question that could be answered by the data available. Document the question you want to explore below. Your investigation should involve at least two variables and should compare at least two groups. You should also use at least one visualization as part of your explorations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Replace this text with your responses and include a visualization below!"

    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing the project! This is only a sampling of the data analysis process: from generating questions, wrangling the data, and to exploring the data. Normally, at this point in the data analysis process, you might want to draw conclusions about the data by performing a statistical test or fitting the data to a model for making predictions. There are also a lot of potential analyses that could be performed on the data which are not possible with only the data provided. For example, detailed location data has not been investigated. Where are the most commonly used docks? What are the most common routes? As another example, weather has potential to have a large impact on daily ridership. How much is ridership impacted when there is rain or snow? Are subscribers or customers affected more by changes in weather?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 7**: Putting the bike share data aside, think of a topic or field of interest where you would like to be able to apply the techniques of data science. What would you like to be able to learn from your chosen subject?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Replace this text with your response!\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**: If we want to share the results of our analysis with others, we aren't limited to giving them a copy of the jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file. We can also export the Notebook output in a form that can be opened even for those without Python installed. From the **File** menu in the upper left, go to the **Download as** submenu. You can then choose a different format that can be viewed more generally, such as HTML (.html) or\n",
    "PDF (.pdf). You may need additional packages or software to perform these exports."

    "\n",
    "The daily fee to rent a Divvy bike will jump by more than 40 percent next week because of a deficit and escalating costs to run the expanding bicycle-sharing system, officials are set to announce Friday. The annual membership will remain at $75.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting Wednesday, the boost from $7 to $9.95 for a 24-hour pass is expected to generate an extra $400,000 during the remainder of 2015, or $800,000 on an annual basis, according to the city and Motivate. That Brooklyn-based company recently took over operation of the 2-year-old program for Chicago under a five-year contract for up to $65 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 24-hour pass includes an unlimited number of trips, each lasting 30 minutes or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Emanuel administration introduced Divvy in 2013 after the city received more than $30 million in government funding to build the bike-share system. Its stated goals were to ensure that the program would be financially self-sustaining and generate revenue growth to support more bicycling infrastructure across Chicago to help reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality and encourage more active lifestyles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The financial endgame is a work in progress, as Divvy has yet to steer clear of red ink, despite some creative bookkeeping, city officials indicated. They said that although Divvy has proved popular among visitors to the downtown and other venues, revenue from daily fees has fallen short of projections, spurring the need to raise the rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Divvy was launched at a time when big cities were just beginning to launch bike-share programs, and many of the financial predictions we made were based on other industries, without having a direct precedent to look to in the bike-share world,\" the city said in a statement. \"... We expect that as the bike-share industry matures, we will be able to attract even more revenue in this manner.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "One-year Divvy discount coming for low-income Chicagoans\n",
    "Divvy posted a $500,000 operating loss in 2014, and the city used grants that it received for the federally funded program to erase the deficit, city officials said.\n",
    "\n",
    "It followed a 2013 operating loss of $171,000, according to city documents. Under the contract, the city bore $154,000 of the loss, while Alta Bicycle Share, the original Divvy contractor that was subsequently bought by Motivate, was responsible for $17,000. Operational revenue from 2014 was used to cover the 2013 loss, officials said.\n",
    "\n",
    "About 86 percent of Divvy's more than 27,000 annual members are Chicago residents, and the price hike in the 24-hour pass will mostly affect tourists and other infrequent users, according to the Chicago Department of Transportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roughly two-thirds of daily users are visitors, CDOT said. It said that nearly 750,000 24-hour passes have been sold to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chicago Transportation Commissioner Rebekah Scheinfeld defended the first rate hike by the public-private partnership that launched Divvy in River North and downtown. Since then, the service area has doubled, she noted.\n",

    "STEVE JOBS liked to describe computers as “bicycles for the mind”—tools that let humans do things faster and more \n",
    "efficiently than their bodies would allow. The internet-connected bikes flooding the streets of urban China could be \n",
    "called “computers for the road”. Networked, trackable and data-generating, they are ones and zeros in aluminium form.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cycles belong to Ofo and Mobike, two startups that, taken together, have raised $2.2bn of capital and are valued at \n",
    "more than $4bn. Each has between 7m and 10m bikes in China, averages 30m-35m rides a day and, having entered more than 100 \n",
    "Chinese cities, is expanding abroad. At the start of 2016 neither firm had a single bike on a public road. \n",
    "Ofo’s canary-yellow cycles and Mobike’s silver-and-orange ones can now be found in cities from Adelaide to London \n",
    "and Singapore to Seattle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most city bike-sharing systems, such as the Vélib scheme in Paris, depend on fixed docks in which cycles must be parked. \n",
    "Ofo and Mobike instead pioneered a “dockless” bike secured with a smart lock that can be released with a smartphone app. \n",
    "They charge much less than public programmes. In London it costs £2 ($2.66), and typically lots of poking at an \n",
    "unresponsive kiosk-mounted screen, just to unlock a city-run shared bike. The equivalent with an Ofo, after an initial \n",
    "deposit, is 50 pence every half an hour and a few seconds to get going. In China rides cost between 0.50 and \n",
    "1 yuan ($0.08-0.15) for 30 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps that the firms save on physical infrastructure such as docks. But the main reason they can afford such low fees\n",
    "is because they have abundant funding: in June Mobike raised $600m, much of it from Tencent, a messaging, gaming and \n",
    "payments giant. (Qualcomm, an American chipmaker, made a smaller investment this month.) In July Ofo raised $700m in \n",
    "a funding round led by Alibaba, an e-commerce and payments company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many smaller, copycat bike-share startups have gone under. Last week it emerged that Bluegogo, a distant third in China’s\n",
    "bike-sharing wars, had gone bust. Its puny $90m in funding and 700,000 bikes were no match for the market leaders.\n",
    "Another operator shut down after 90% of its 1,200 bikes were stolen six months after launch. Many schemes have been \n",
    "funded with scant financial analysis by investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nor are Ofo and Mobike profitable, though not for want of growth. China’s bike-sharing market grew from 33m yuan in the \n",
    "third quarter of 2016 to 3.9bn yuan in the second quarter of 2017, says iResearch, a market-research firm. Zhang Yanqi, \n",
    "an Ofo co-founder, thinks China could support 300m rides a day, up from 50m-60m today. Both firms believe rental fees \n",
    "alone could make them profitable businesses if they stopped spending on expansion at home and abroad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysts reckon the real money may be in other sources of revenue. The firms hold hundreds of millions worth of yuan in\n",
    "deposits collected from users. For now this money lies unutilised—Chinese law is unclear about how, if it all, it can be \n",
    "used. But firms hope that will change. Lending it would be one possibility. Another idea is a sort of crowdsourced \n",
    "logistics, asking riders to carry along packages in exchange for free rides or a small payment. Mobike already incentivises\n",
    "users to move its bikes around to high-demand areas by offering “red envelopes” worth a few yuan. Advertising on\n",
    "“billboards” within wheels is also a promising avenue. And the firms can agree with brands to offer digital coupons for \n",
    "shops on a rider’s route. Mobike works with McDonald’s and JD.com, an e-commerce company, to do just that.\n",
    "\n",
    "But most value could come from data, especially used in partnership with Alibaba and Tencent. \n",
    "The bike-sharing firms are already becoming part of their strategic investors’ business models. Ofo uses Alibaba’s \n",
    "credit-rating system to allow users to rent bikes with no deposit, for example. More data could be shared. As Mr Zhang \n",
    "puts it, the firm’s main investor, Alibaba, “already knows how much [users] spend, where they spend it and what they spend\n",
    "it on. But with us they have a very strong idea of people’s total activity.” Mobike says it does not share data on a \n",
    "commercial basis with any firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bike wars recall the one between ride-hailing firms in China, which ended with mergers that left one player, Didi \n",
    "Chuxing. Rumours of a possible merger between Ofo and Mobike have been swirling for weeks. Allen Zhu, an early investor in\n",
    "Ofo who is pushing for a merger, says making money is terrifically hard with so much competition. But neither Ofo nor\n",
    "Mobike is willing publicly to admit it. “In my entire career at Ofo I have spent less than five minutes talking about\n",
